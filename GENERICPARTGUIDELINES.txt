NOTE: FOR SPECIFIC PARTS OTHER TAGS MAY BE APPLIED. THESE ARE SIMPLY GUIDELINES.

Decouplers and fairings:
0.625 and smaller decouplers: tag as "start"
0.625 and smaller fairings: tag as "basicConstruction"
0.9375/1.25 decouplers and fairings: tag as "basicConstruction"
1.5/1.875 decouplers and fairings: tag as "earlyConstruction"
2.5 decouplers and fairings: tag as "goodConstruction"
3.125/3.75 decouplers and fairings: tag as "advConstruction"
Larger parts will require more nodes

LFO tanks:
0.625 and smaller tanks: tag as "start"
0.9375/1.25 tanks: tag as "basicConstruction"
1.5/1.875 tanks: tag as "earlyConstruction"
2.5 tanks: tag as "goodConstruction"
3.125/3.75 tanks: tag as "advConstruction"

Hydrolox tanks:
place in relevant nodes

Generic, non-replica engines:
If a similar looking and performing IRL engine can be found, tag with the same as said engine
If no RL analouge can be found, place in a construction node with relevant diameter or as balance suggests.

batteries:
capacity < 200 = EarlySci 
capacity < 500 = MidSci
capacity < 1000 = AdvSci
capacity < 1500 = InterSci
capacity < 2000 = SuperSci

solar panels assuming 1 EC/s is 1 kW:
output < 1 kW = EarlySci
output < 5 kW = MidSci
output < 10 kW = AdvSci
output < 20 kW = InterSci
output < 100 kW = SurfaceSci
output > 100 kW = SuperSci

science:
place according to best judgement

wheels:
place according to best judgement

Comms:
range from Kerbin to Kerbin: EarlySci
range from Kerbin to Mun/Minmus: MidSci
range from Kerbin to Eve/Duna: AdvSci
range from Kerbin to Lindor/Jool/Moho: InterSci
range from Kerbin to Eeloo/Hamek/Nara: SurfaceSci
range from Kerbin to Nara/Interstellar: SuperSci
